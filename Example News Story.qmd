An English major at George Washington University is not the student you think of when describing an average student studying in the nation’s capital. However, D.C. native Kayla Laws has shown the dynamic between high profile connections and finding your own passions. 
	
After spending each holiday and school year living in Washington D.C., surrounded by the hustle and bustle of politicians picking their children up from school, making friends with children of high political status, Laws moved to Maryland.  

According to Laws, her family’s decision to move to Maryland came later in her life. However, with her roots grounded in D.C. with four generations of Washingtonians, Laws found packing up her 18 years of D.C. living to move to Maryland during her freshman year of college. 

20 year old Kayla Laws, is a Africana Studies and English student at the George Washington University, minoring in Journalism and Mass Communications. Her love of D.C. brought her to GW and as she reflects on her childhood, she recalls the unique experience of living in the country’s capital. 

“When you’re young you don’t know who is who, but your parents do,” said Laws when asked about high profile families she grew up with. 

Laws said that learning at GW is a different experience in comparison to many others because of how public figures are mentioned. Many politicians mentioned in classes she has met personally and knows their families. 

Laws painted the picture of the lavish lifestyles of the political elites including Tucker Carlson, the father of her good friend. Maids and chefs served in the house on a daily basis, while Laws and other children went on about their playdates.

“I never questioned it, I was a shy kid and I didn’t like playdates,” said Laws. “They were just very different lifestyles.” 

Laws’ distinctive childhood was a result of generations of family members born and raised in the nation's capital. 
 
“My family is from North Carolina and Mississippi. They moved up north because there were better opportunities for the African American population,” said Laws. 

After recalling the numerous activities she tried throughout her childhood, she said that writing was one of the activities her parents encouraged her to do as well as making connections. 

Since her upbringing in D.C., Laws has been published in Emerging Voices vol 1 and other publications that highlight young voices.

I love Maya Anglou’s work, especially The Bluest Eye, said Laws. Passionate about poems and short stories, Laws remains inspired by the work of Angelou. 

The English path didn’t deter me, however, I knew writing couldn’t take me to where I wanted to be, said laws. 

Laws has future plans of becoming an author and going to law school after graduating from George Washington University. 

Laws hopes to stay in D.C. cementing herself in the roots of her childhood and family.“D.C. is where I’m from, it's where I grew up,” said Laws.
