    "text": "Here is an example of a news story done during my time at GWU\nZazni Vlijter Advanced News Reporting Student Feature Story\nAn English major at George Washington University is not the student you think of when describing an average student studying in the nation’s capital. However, D.C. native Kayla Laws has shown the dynamic between high profile connections and finding your own passions.\nAfter spending each holiday and school year living in Washington D.C., surrounded by the hustle and bustle of politicians picking their children up from school, making friends with children of high political status, Laws moved to Maryland.\nAccording to Laws, her family’s decision to move to Maryland came later in her life. However, with her roots grounded in D.C. with four generations of Washingtonians, Laws found packing up her 18 years of D.C. living to move to Maryland during her freshman year of college.\n20 year old Kayla Laws, is a Africana Studies and English student at the George Washington University, minoring in Journalism and Mass Communications. Her love of D.C. brought her to GW and as she reflects on her childhood, she recalls the unique experience of living in the country’s capital.\n“When you’re young you don’t know who is who, but your parents do,” said Laws when asked about high profile families she grew up with.\nLaws said that learning at GW is a different experience in comparison to many others because of how public figures are mentioned. Many politicians mentioned in classes she has met personally and knows their families.\nLaws painted the picture of the lavish lifestyles of the political elites including Tucker Carlson, the father of her good friend. Maids and chefs served in the house on a daily basis, while Laws and other children went on about their playdates.\n“I never questioned it, I was a shy kid and I didn’t like playdates,” said Laws. “They were just very different lifestyles.”\nLaws’ distinctive childhood was a result of generations of family members born and raised in the nation’s capital.\n“My family is from North Carolina and Mississippi. They moved up north because there were better opportunities for the African American population,” said Laws.\nAfter recalling the numerous activities she tried throughout her childhood, she said that writing was one of the activities her parents encouraged her to do as well as making connections.\nSince her upbringing in D.C., Laws has been published in Emerging Voices vol 1 and other publications that highlight young voices.\nI love Maya Anglou’s work, especially The Bluest Eye, said Laws. Passionate about poems and short stories, Laws remains inspired by the work of Angelou.\nThe English path didn’t deter me, however, I knew writing couldn’t take me to where I wanted to be, said laws.\nLaws has future plans of becoming an author and going to law school after graduating from George Washington University.\nLaws hopes to stay in D.C. cementing herself in the roots of her childhood and family.“D.C. is where I’m from, it’s where I grew up,” said Laws."

    "text": "The Alteration of Aura and Loss of Reality\nWhile I was living in Manhattan, I found myself surrounded continuously by movie icons in reproduced forms from street vendors selling pictures of Audrey Hepburn to Rosie the Riveter posters being sold outside the grocery store. As a child, I had a fascination with Marylin Monroe due to my exposure to her glamor throughout the city and eventually through her famous movies. However, my exposure to Marylin Monroe and her movies broadened as I grew up and began to understand the star’s immense sexualization by the public as an individual. There is an image in particular that I had seen numerous reproductions from the movie ” The Seven Year Itch.” Reproductions of this iconic look from Marylin’s movie is seen in her wax figure at Madame Tussauds and various films depicting Marylin’s legacy. However, there is one still in particular that remains one of Monroe’s most famous pictures from “The Seven Year Itch.”\nThe exceptionally well-known white dress and the depiction of Monroe’s dress flying upwards as she attempts to hold it down remains one of Monroe’s most recognizable images to this day called The Flying Skirt. This image’s mass reproduction is seen through millions of platforms on social media, poster sales, and even recreations on Halloween. After learning more about Marylin’s difficult rise to fame and how the film industry type casted her into unfufilling and sexualized roles, I understood the importance of the message behind the iconic image.\nIn ” The Precession of Simulacra,” William Baudrillard discusses the understanding of reality as we have lost the tangibility of existence and instead replace it with the idea of that reality. In other words, we have an understanding of ideas and our desires, although the signifier does not yet exist. Baudrillard applies this to the consumer needs and capitalistic view of mass production; however, we can discuss this regarding the meaning of an image and how it is taken out of the original meaning’s context and changed by the consumer market. Therefore we can apply Baudrillard’s theory of reality to the mass production of Marylin Monroe’s iconic photograph and the public’s perception of it.\nIn the image I encountered numerous times in NYC, Monroe portrays a character that the scriptwriters have clearly sexualized. The act of pushing down a dress being blown up by the wind is directly from one scene in the movie that she is acting in, not a naturally staged image. The image does not depict anything except the character she is portraying, which is crucial for the public’s context. However, The Flying Skirt’s mass reproduction takes it out of its original context and values the signifier over the image and the context of the image itself. I believe that the consumer market takes Monroe’s acting and places it upon her personality as the consumers first make meaning of the object before the reality and tangibility of the original image. Therefore, the image that portrays Monroe’s sexualized character transforms into the understanding of Monroe as an individual, contributing to the sexualization of Monroe outside of the context of acting. Baudrillard states, “It is a generation by models of a real without origin or reality: a hyperreal” (1483). In this case, the sexualization is the “real” as Monroe’s perceived sexual nature is derived from understanding the image outside of its “origin or reality,” creating the hyperreal. In this case, the hyperreal is how the public understands Monroe’s image and her sexualization as a person rather than exclusively the characters she’s hired to play.\nThe consumer appeal to the signifier is rooted in the male-dominated market that favors the sexualization of women that overlooks the importance of understanding the signified. Monroe’s image was able to be mass-produced and taken outside of its original context as it fed into the hyperreal image of women that has been perpetuated beyond Monroe’s image and onto female figures in general. My ability to constantly view this particular image of Monroe while passing by street vendors is rooted in the masculine lens that created the sexualized image of Monroe rather than recognizing the persona she is portraying.\nGrowing up during the digital era has exposed me to various social media platforms. Some that are no longer around today and some that have become immediately recognizable and popular. I find myself going through waves of giving attention to particular media platforms over others, however, one of my favorite platforms at the moment happens to be a video-sharing app called Tik Tok. Tik Tok allows individuals throughout the world to participate in dance, comedy, and singing trends. One trend that seems to have taken off on Tik Tok is one where a piece of art is shown and the individual attempts to physically recreate the image the artist is portraying. While scrolling through Tik Tok, I was constantly encountering one particular image that most people we’re attempting to recreate; The Fallen Angel by Alexandre Cabanel.\nThe Fallen Angel depicts Lucefier shielding his face as he cries after he has fallen from heaven. Many individuals I encountered attempting to reproduce this image, assumed a similar position, and recreated Lucefier’s facial expression in an attempt to recreate the original image. The reproduction of this image can be viewed through the lens of Walter Benjamin’s theory of the loss of aura in “The Work of Art in the Age of Technological Reproducibility.” Benjamin argues that art loses its aura, or the “here and now…” (978) when it is reproduced and taken out of its original context in terms of placement. Therefore, the mass reproduction of the original image loses its aura and authenticity as it is made accessible to the mass audience outside the context of the original. We can apply this to the newest Tik Tok trend, although, I wish to alter Benjamin’s argument and argue that the loss of aura can appear on different levels of mass reproduction.\nWhen we apply Bejamin’s theory of aura to the trend we can see three different levels of reproduction that result in the loss of the original aura. The first level of reproduction is the ability to access the image on a digital scale, outside of the context of the original placement of The Fallen Angel. The mass reproduction of the original image is the first level of reproduction that we can equate to the loss of the aura. The second level of reproduction would be the use of the image within the video as it takes the digital image and reproduces it to show the image of the original painting before it is recreated by the individual. The video depicts the two reproductions of the original painting one from the original digital reproduction and the second from the reproduction of that digital image in the video. The last level of reproduction of the image of The Fallen Angel is through the physical attempt to recreate the image itself by the individual making the video. These three layers of reproduction contribute to the loss of the original aura of the image Benjamin discusses. However, with the expansion of digital platforms, we can place this loss of originality and aura on different levels of reproduction as there can be multiple reproductions of a reproduced image.\nWe can view the appeal of this media reproduction through the desire for fame and recognition on large media platforms. Benjamin’s theory of exhibition value, which discusses how the public receives works on a mass public scale, depicts the value that we can see through the media and the public understanding of images today however the reproduction of images can also contribute to monetary value for other individuals. The value of fame and profit benefits the individual, therefore the loss of aura is not what’s valued to the individual, instead, it is the outcome of the reproduction that is important for capitalistic profit.\nAlthough mass reproduction and recreation can lead to great social change, the issue lies in the public’s perception of the images they are exposed to through this mass reproduction. Growing up I understood that Monroe was viewed as a sexual symbol in the film industry, however, this sexualized vision of her was not a result of the context of her acting, but rather the idea placed upon her images for the masculine consumer. Therefore, the value of reproduction is sourced in how to public perceives meaning within the image. There cannot be any effective social change until the consumer market focuses on the tangible reality of the image, rather than the idea and profit that comes from the removal of context. When we start to stray from placing profit above tangible truth, then we are able to create great social change. However, our society today depicts the complications in valuing truth as it doesn’t appeal to the mass market. A great alteration in the market is needed in order to change the exhibition value of images and alter the value into one that promotes truth rather than profit.\nWork Cited\nBenjamin, Walter “The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility” The Norton Anthology Theory and Criticism Third Edition, Edited by Peter Simon, W.W Norton & Company, Inc, 2018, pp 976\nBaudrillard, Jean ” The Precession of Simulacra” The Norton Anthology Theory and Criticism Third Edition, Edited by Peter Simon, W.W Norton & Company, Inc, 2018, pp 1483\nCabanel, Alexandre The Fallen Angel. 1868.
