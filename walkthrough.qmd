We'll start by loading. our libraries.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

We're going to look at some sample data from Texas on housing prices throughout the state.

First we'll load data.

```{r}
# run this line below load the data for this assignment
# we'll use a built-in dataset from the ggplot2 package (loaded as party of the tidyverse)
housesales <- ggplot2::txhousing
```

Now, let's see what the data looks like

```{r}
housesales %>% 
  head()
```
